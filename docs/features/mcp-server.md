# MCP Server

Manage your BFFless instance directly from AI coding assistants using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). The built-in MCP server exposes all admin operations as tools — projects, deployments, aliases, domains, pipelines, proxy rules, cache rules, and more — so your AI assistant can create, update, and query resources on your behalf.

## Overview

The MCP server is available at `/mcp` on every BFFless instance. It uses the **Streamable HTTP** transport and authenticates via API key. Any MCP-compatible client can connect — including Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and custom integrations.

**What you can do:**

- Create projects and manage deployments
- Promote and roll back aliases
- Configure custom domains and subdomains
- Build data-backed APIs with pipeline schemas and proxy rules
- Set up file uploads, cache rules, and AI chat pipelines
- Query and manage pipeline data records
- Debug pipeline execution with logs
- Manage users, roles, and API keys

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A running BFFless instance (self-hosted or managed)
- An API key with appropriate permissions

### 1. Create an API Key

Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** in your BFFless admin panel and create a new key. Copy it — you'll need it for the next step.

:::tip
API keys can be scoped to a specific project or granted global access. For AI assistants, a global key is usually most convenient.

### 2. Connect Your MCP Client

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http bffless https://admin.yourdomain.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This adds the server to your `~/.claude.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bffless": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://admin.yourdomain.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor / Other MCP Clients

Add the following to your MCP client configuration:

- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP
- **URL:** `https://admin.yourdomain.com/mcp`
- **Header:** `X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY`

### 3. Verify the Connection

Ask your AI assistant to list your projects:

> "List all my BFFless projects"

The assistant will call the `list_projects` tool and return your project list.

### Connecting Multiple Instances

You can connect to multiple BFFless instances simultaneously by giving each a unique name:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http bffless-production https://admin.production.yourdomain.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: PROD_KEY"

claude mcp add --transport http bffless-staging https://admin.staging.yourdomain.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: STAGING_KEY"
```

Each instance is fully isolated — tools are scoped to the workspace they're connected to.

## Common Workflows

### Deploy a Static Site

Ask your AI assistant:

> "Create a new project called `my-org/landing-page`, then set up a production alias and map it to `landing.example.com`"

Behind the scenes, the assistant will:

1. `create_project` — Create the project
2. `create_alias` — Point "production" to the latest deployment
3. `create_domain` — Map the subdomain to the project

### Build a Data-Backed API

> "Create a contacts schema with name, email, and company fields, then set up GET and POST endpoints at `/api/contacts`"

The assistant will:

1. `create_pipeline_schema` — Define the data model
2. `create_proxy_rule_set` — Group the API rules
3. `create_proxy_rule` — Create GET endpoint with `data_query` handler
4. `create_proxy_rule` — Create POST endpoint with `data_create` handler

### Promote a Deployment

> "Show me the latest deployments for `my-org/app` and promote the most recent one to production"

1. `list_deployments` — Find the latest commit SHA
2. `update_alias` — Point the production alias to the new SHA

### Roll Back

> "Roll back the production alias for `my-org/app` to the previous deployment"

1. `list_deployments` — Find the previous commit SHA
2. `update_alias` — Point production back to the old SHA

### Debug a Pipeline

> "Enable debug logging on my `/api/contacts` endpoint and show me the last few execution logs"

1. `enable_pipeline_debug` — Turn on logging for the rule
2. `list_pipeline_logs` — View recent executions
3. `get_pipeline_log` — Inspect a specific execution's step-by-step data

## Technical Details

### Authentication

All MCP requests are authenticated via the `X-API-Key` header. The server uses the same API key system as the REST API — keys created in the admin panel work for both.

### Transport

The MCP server uses **Streamable HTTP** transport in stateless mode with JSON responses enabled. This means:

- No persistent WebSocket connections required
- Each request is independent (no session state)
- Compatible with HTTP proxies and load balancers

### Endpoint

The MCP endpoint is always available at:

```
https://admin.<your-domain>/mcp
```

For self-hosted instances, this is typically:

```
https://admin.<PRIMARY_DOMAIN>/mcp
```

### Rate Limiting

MCP requests are subject to the same rate limits as the REST API. For high-volume automation, consider using the REST API directly.
