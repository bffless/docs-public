# Setup Wizard

After installing BFFless, you'll complete a setup wizard to configure your instance. This guide walks you through each step.

## Accessing the Setup Wizard

Once the installer finishes and you run `./start.sh`, visit:

```
https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

You'll be automatically redirected to the setup wizard.

## Step 1: Create Admin Account

Create your administrator account to manage the platform.

<img src="/img/setup-wizard-step1.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Create Admin Account showing email, password, and confirm password fields" className="screenshot" />

Enter your email address and choose a strong password (minimum 8 characters). This account will have full administrative access to your BFFless instance.

Click **Create Account & Continue** to proceed to storage configuration.

## Step 2: Configure Storage

Choose where your deployed assets will be stored.

<img src="/img/setup-wizard-step2.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Configure Storage showing provider dropdown with MinIO, Local Filesystem, S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure options" className="screenshot" />

:::tip Quick Start with Local Filesystem
**Local Filesystem** is the simplest and fastest option for testing. It requires no additional services and uses fewer resources. However, it has filesystem limitations and is not intended for large amounts of uploads. For production or large-scale deployments, use **S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Azure Blob Storage**.
:::

### Local Filesystem

Best for testing and small deployments:

1. Select **Local Filesystem** from the dropdown
2. Keep the default path or specify a custom directory
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify
4. Click **Continue**

### MinIO (Pre-configured)

MinIO is an S3-compatible object storage that runs alongside your BFFless instance:

1. Select **MinIO** from the dropdown
2. The connection details are pre-filled from your installation
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify
4. Click **Continue**

### S3 / S3-Compatible Storage

Use this for AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, or other S3-compatible services:

| Field             | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Region            | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)             |
| Access Key ID     | Your AWS access key                        |
| Secret Access Key | Your AWS secret key                        |
| Bucket            | S3 bucket name                             |
| Endpoint          | Custom endpoint for S3-compatible services |

### Google Cloud Storage

| Field           | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Project ID      | Your GCP project ID            |
| Bucket          | GCS bucket name                |
| Service Account | JSON key file contents or path |

### Azure Blob Storage

| Field          | Description                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Account Name   | Azure storage account name |
| Container Name | Blob container name        |
| Account Key    | Storage account access key |

After selecting and configuring your provider, click **Test Connection** to verify it works, then click **Continue**.

## Step 3: Configure Cache

Configure caching to improve performance and reduce storage costs.

<img src="/img/setup-wizard-step3.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Cache Configuration showing In-Memory LRU and Redis options" className="screenshot" />

:::tip In-Memory (LRU) is Usually Sufficient
**In-Memory (LRU)** caching is recommended for most deployments. It's fast, simple, and requires no additional services. Redis is usually overkill unless you have multi-server deployments or need cache persistence across restarts.
:::

### In-Memory (LRU) - Recommended

Best for single-server deployments:

- Fast, single-instance cache
- No additional services required
- Cache is cleared on restart (usually fine)

Select **In-Memory (LRU)** and optionally adjust:
- **Max Cache Size (MB)**: Default 100MB is good for most use cases
- **Default TTL**: How long to cache files (default: 86400 seconds / 24 hours)
- **Max File Size (MB)**: Files larger than this won't be cached (default: 10MB)

### Redis

Only needed for advanced scenarios:

- Multi-server deployments with shared cache
- Cache persistence across restarts
- Very large datasets

Click **Save & Continue** to proceed.

## Step 4: Configure Email (Optional)

Email is primarily needed for password reset functionality.

<img src="/img/setup-wizard-step4.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Email Configuration showing SMTP, SendGrid, and Resend options" className="screenshot" />

:::tip Resend or Skip
**SMTP is often blocked** by cloud hosting providers (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.). We recommend either:
- **Resend** - Free tier available, works on all hosting providers
- **Skip for Now** - Configure later, password reset links will be logged instead
:::

### Resend (Recommended)

1. Sign up for a free account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create an API key in your Resend dashboard
3. Select **Resend** and enter your API key
4. Set your From Address (must be verified in Resend)

### Skip for Now

If you skip email configuration, password reset won't send emails. Instead, reset links are logged to the console. You can view them with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Look for lines containing the password reset URL when a user requests a reset.

### SMTP

Traditional SMTP usually doesn't work on cloud providers due to port blocking. If you have a working SMTP server:

| Field        | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Host         | SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)      |
| Port         | SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)      |
| Username     | SMTP username                             |
| Password     | SMTP password or app-specific password    |
| From Address | Sender email (e.g., `noreply@domain.com`) |

Click **Test Connection** to verify, then click **Continue**.

## Step 5: Complete Setup

Review your configuration and finalize the setup.

<img src="/img/setup-wizard-step5.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Complete Setup showing configuration review and optimization recommendations" className="screenshot" />

The summary shows your configured options. If you chose **Local Filesystem** storage and **In-Memory** caching, you'll see an optimization recommendation.

:::tip Save RAM by Disabling Unused Services
If you're not using MinIO or Redis, disable them to save ~224MB RAM. Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
ENABLE_MINIO=false
ENABLE_REDIS=false
```

Then restart:

```bash
./stop.sh
./start.sh
```

This is especially helpful on smaller VPS instances (1GB RAM).

Click **Complete Setup** to finish and access your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Setup Wizard

If you see a login page instead of the setup wizard:

- The setup may already be complete
- Try logging in with the admin credentials you created
- Or reset the installation and start fresh

### Storage Connection Failed

- **MinIO**: Ensure MinIO container is running (`docker compose ps`)
- **S3**: Verify IAM permissions include `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket`
- **GCS**: Check service account has Storage Admin role

### Redis Connection Failed

- Verify Redis container is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check the password matches your `.env` file
- For external Redis, ensure firewall allows connections

### Email Test Failed

- **SMTP**: Gmail requires an "App Password" (not your regular password)
- **API providers**: Verify the from address is verified in your provider's dashboard
- Check firewall allows outbound connections on the SMTP port
