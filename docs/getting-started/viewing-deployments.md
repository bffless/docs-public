# Viewing Deployments

After your GitHub Action completes, your deployment will appear in BFFless. This guide covers how to browse deployments, set up aliases, and map domains to serve your content.

## Repository Overview

Navigate to your repository to see all deployments.

The repository page shows:

- **Recent Deployments** - Each commit that's been uploaded
- **Aliases** - Named pointers to specific deployments (e.g., `production`)
- **Storage Stats** - How much storage the repository is using

## Browsing Deployed Content

Click on any deployment to browse its contents:

- **File Browser** - Navigate through your deployed files and folders
- **Preview** - View HTML pages, images, and other assets directly in the browser
- **Deployment Info** - Commit SHA, upload time, file count, and size

:::tip Quick Preview
Click any HTML file to preview it directly. This is useful for reviewing changes before promoting to production.

## Setting Up Aliases

Aliases provide stable URLs that point to specific deployments. Use them for:

- **production** - Your live site
- **staging** - Pre-production testing
- **preview** - Feature previews

:::tip Automatic Aliases from GitHub Actions
If you followed the [First Deployment](/getting-started/first-deployment) guide, your GitHub Action already creates aliases automatically—`production` for the main branch and `preview` for feature branches.
:::

### Creating an Alias Manually

You can also create aliases manually:

1. Go to your repository and click the **Aliases** tab
2. Click **Create Alias**
3. Enter a name (e.g., `staging`)
4. Select the deployment to point to
5. Click **Create**

The alias URL will be:

```
https://admin.yourdomain.com/public/owner/repo/alias/production/
```

### Updating Aliases

You can update an alias to point to a different commit at any time—useful for rollbacks or promoting a specific version.

<img src="/img/viewing-deployment-alias-commit.png" alt="Update Alias dialog showing commit selection dropdown" className="screenshot" />

1. Go to the **Aliases** tab
2. Click the edit icon next to the alias you want to update
3. Select a different commit from the dropdown
4. Click **Update Alias**

This enables instant rollbacks—just point `production` to a previous commit.

### Alias Visibility

Each alias can have its own visibility setting:

- **Private** - Requires authentication to access
- **Public** - Accessible to anyone with the URL
- **Inherit from project** - Uses the repository's default visibility

This lets you keep `staging` private while making `production` public.

## Mapping Domains to Aliases

Connect your aliases to domains so users can access your deployments at friendly URLs like `www.yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`.

### Using Your Primary Domain

The simplest option is to serve content on your primary domain (the one you configured during setup).

<img src="/img/viewing-deployment-primary-content.png" alt="Site Settings showing Primary Domain Content configuration" className="screenshot" />

1. From the homepage, click **Site Settings** in the Admin section
2. Enable **Primary domain content**
3. Select your **Repository** (e.g., `bffless/demo`)
4. Select the **Deployment Alias** (e.g., `production`)
5. Optionally set a **Path** if your build outputs to a subdirectory (e.g., `/dist`)
6. Optionally enable **Add www subdomain** to support both `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com`
7. Enable **Single Page Application (SPA)** if using React, Vue, or Angular with client-side routing
8. Click **Save Changes**

Your app is now live on your primary domain!

### Mapping Custom Subdomains

For additional deployments, you can map custom subdomains to serve content at URLs like <a href="https://demo.docs.bffless.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo.docs.bffless.app ↗</a> or `staging.docs.yourdomain.com`.

<img src="/img/viewing-deployment-domains.png" alt="Create Domain Mapping dialog for subdomain configuration" className="screenshot" />

1. Click **Domains** in the sidebar navigation
2. Click **+ New Domain**
3. Select **Subdomain (Recommended)** as the Domain Type
4. Enter your **Subdomain** prefix (e.g., `demo`)
5. Optionally set a **Deployment Alias** (e.g., `production`, `staging`) — defaults to `latest` if empty
6. Optionally set a **Path** if your build outputs to a subdirectory (e.g., `/dist`)
7. Choose the **Visibility** setting (Public, Private, or inherit from project)
8. Enable **SPA Mode** if using React, Vue, or Angular with client-side routing
9. Click **Create Domain**

Once created, SSL certificates are automatically provisioned and DNS is verified. The domain card will show:
- **SSL Enabled** - HTTPS is active
- **DNS Verified** - Domain is properly configured
- **Mapping** - Shows the alias and path (e.g., `/production/dist`)

:::tip Multiple Subdomains
You can create as many subdomains as you need — perfect for staging environments, feature previews, or serving multiple projects from the same workspace.
:::

### Mapping Custom Domains

You can also map fully custom domains (like `www.example.com` or `docs.mycompany.io`) to your deployments. This is useful when you want to serve content on a domain that isn't a subdomain of your primary domain.

1. Click **Domains** in the sidebar navigation
2. Click **+ New Domain**
3. Select **Custom Domain** as the Domain Type
4. Enter the full domain name (e.g., `www.staticassetshostingplatform.com`)
5. Configure the deployment alias, path, and visibility settings
6. Click **Create Domain**

After creating the domain, you'll see DNS configuration instructions:

- **A Record** - Point your domain to your server's IP address
- **www behavior** - Optionally configure redirects between `www` and non-www versions

Click **Verify DNS** once you've configured your DNS records. The verification checks that the domain resolves correctly.

:::caution Custom Domain Limitations
Custom domains are always **public** — authentication cookies don't work across different domains. If you need private content, use subdomains instead.
:::

### Custom Domains with Cloudflare

If your custom domain is also managed through Cloudflare (separate from your primary domain), there are special considerations:

#### DNS Verification

When a custom domain uses Cloudflare's proxy (orange cloud), DNS lookups return Cloudflare's edge IPs instead of your server IP. BFFless automatically detects Cloudflare IPs and accepts them as valid during DNS verification.

#### SSL Configuration

Cloudflare Origin Certificates are **domain-specific** — a certificate for `j5s.dev` won't work for `staticassetshostingplatform.com`. You have two options:

| Option | Cloudflare SSL Mode | Setup |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Simple (Recommended)** | Full | Set SSL mode to "Full" in Cloudflare. This accepts any valid certificate from your origin. |
| **Strict** | Full (Strict) | Generate a separate Origin Certificate for each custom domain in its Cloudflare zone. |

To configure SSL mode for your custom domain:

1. Log into Cloudflare for your custom domain's zone
2. Go to **SSL/TLS > Overview**
3. Set encryption mode to **Full** (not Full Strict)

This allows Cloudflare to connect securely to your origin using the existing certificate, even though the hostname doesn't match.

:::tip Primary Domain vs Custom Domains
Your primary domain (configured during setup) can use **Full (Strict)** with its Origin Certificate. Each Cloudflare zone has independent SSL settings, so custom domains can use **Full** mode while your primary domain stays on **Full (Strict)**.
:::

#### Non-Cloudflare Custom Domains

If your custom domain doesn't use Cloudflare:

1. Point DNS directly to your server's IP address (shown in the DNS instructions)
2. BFFless will verify the domain via HTTP health check
3. For SSL, you can use Let's Encrypt or configure your own certificate
